I'm Julian Cheal, a British Ruby/Rails developer with a penÂ­chant for tweed, fine coffee, and homebrewing.

When not working, I've helped organise [fun events around the world that teach people to program flying robots](http://nodecopter.com){:target="_blank"}. I also occasionally [speak](http://juliancheal.co.uk/#talks){:target="_blank"} at international conferences on the intersection of programming and robotics.

In the past, I've worked at [The University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} and at two startups: Artolo and [Bardowl](http://bardowl.com){:target="_blank"}. More recently, I was building <span class="em em-cloud" title="Clouds"></span> <span class="em em-cloud"></span> at [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com){:target="_blank"}. Now I am building Open Source <span class="em em-cloud" title="Clouds"></span> <span class="em em-cloud"></span> at [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com){:target="_blank"}
